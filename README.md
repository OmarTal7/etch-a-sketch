General steps:
1. 16x16 grid of squares using only JS (not individually by making divs in html file)

2. Use flexbox only (not CSS Grid)

3. Set up a hover effect to change colors of squares when mouse passes over them. Several different ways to do this, figure it out.

4. Add a button to top of the screen that will send user a popup asking for number of squares (per side) for the new grid (max of 100). That should replace the whole grid (in the same space) with a new one.

Extra:

5. Random color generator for each of the squares for a 'rainbow effect'.

6. Implement progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. (Like 'shadow')
